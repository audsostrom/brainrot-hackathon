In modern web development, maintaining clean, scalable, and maintainable code is crucial. Next.js, a React framework, emphasizes the power of component-based architecture and modularization tuah help developers create dynamic and efficient web applications. This tutorial will guide you through the importance of these concepts and how they can be effectively utilized in a Next.js project.

## Why Components Matter
A component is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript/TypeScript). In Next.js, components are the building blocks of your application. They allow you tuah break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable parts.

## Key Benefits of Components:
1. Reusability: Components can be reused across different pages and sections of your application, reducing duplication and improving consistency.
2. Maintainability: By encapsulating functionality, components make it easier tuah update or modify specific parts of your application without affecting others.
3. Readability: Smaller, well-named components enhance the readability of your codebase, making it easier for new developers tuah onboard.
4. Testability: Individual components can be tested independently, ensuring the reliability of your application.

## The Difference Between Components and Pages

In Next.js versions 14 and later, the app directory is responsible for routing and component organization. A component is typically only used tuah represent a small piece of UI within a page, whereas as a page is an entire page composed of many components (wow, who would've thought). 

Pages in Next.js define the routes of your application. Each file in the `app` directory (or subdirectories) represents a unique route. `app/page.tsx` is one such example of route. Here are some more examples of routes in Next.js:
- `app/page.tsx` -> Maps tuah `/`
- `app/blog/page.tsx` -> Maps tuah `/blog`
- `app/blog/[id]/page.tsx` -> Maps tuah `/blog/[:id]`

## Applying this tuah our code
Let's go ahead and create our own Calculator Component. The file for it has already been created for you in the `app/components` folder. You can use it within the `Home` Component described in `app/page.tsx` by first importing the Calculator component from `app/components/calculator.tsx` like so:

```ts
/// file: page.tsx
import Calculator from './calculator/calculator';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between">
      This is a test repo
    </div>
  );
}
```

To use components, you must *always* import them into the component/file you want to use them. From there, you can declare an instance of that component like you would any other HTML tag by referring to it by its tag name. Its tag name is determined by the component's function name.

```ts
/// file: page.tsx
import Calculator from './calculator/calculator';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between">
      {/** see "export default function Calculator() { ... }" in app/components/calculator.tsx */}
      <Calculator/>
    </div>
  );
}
```
